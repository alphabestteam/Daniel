1. 
switch is a networking device that directs data traffic 
within a local area network  based on the MAC addresses of devices. 
It solves problems like reducing network congestion, preventing collisions,
enhancing security, and improving overall network performance by intelligently forwarding data to the right destination.
2.
A switch determines the physical interface (port) to send each packet by looking at the destination device's MAC address in the packet
header and referencing a table that maps MAC addresses to ports.
It then forwards the packet to the appropriate port, ensuring it reaches the correct destination.
