1.  magic function - for example the operator '+' can only add arguments but not object. 
    behind the operator + there is built in class __add__ that makes the adding.
    but this classes are changeable. So if i want to modify the class that he will add also object i can do it.
    another 3 examples - 
    1.'__abs__' makes absolute values.
    2.'__pow__' Takes a number and raises it to the power of a given number to the function
    3.'__eq__'  equal its behind the operator '=' 
2.
    the str method return string that human can read. if we wouldn't override str, python will use repr function which return unreadable string.
3.
    it will check if two variables point to the same location in the memory

4. 
    overloading operator - change the behavior of magic function. if the regular functionality of '+' operator is to add two numbers, we can overloading this method and give it extra meaning.

5. i wrote the errors inside main class.
