1.
    NoSQL databases are non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables
    for example to the diff between sql and noSql, if we want to add person's name to noSql we use key and value to perform this.

2. 
    advantges - 1. Enable easy updates to schema and fields
                2. databases are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data, which means that they can accommodate dynamic changes to the data model
                3.friendly for agile development
    disadvatges
                1.There is no reliable standard for NoSQL yet which can cause to two databases look differently.
                2.mongo doesnt have access to backup data.
                3. the sotreage document is large because some databases are store the data in json files.

3.
    database - built from multiple collections.
    collections - schemaless and contains documents
    document - mongo stored data in BSON documents.BSON can store more data types than json. 
    inside the document, key and values are stored.
    every documents, has unique id.
4.
    id helps to manage documents by providing an easy way to track them by their id. Also can avoid duplicate keys.
    if we wouldnt defined the id, it will create auto id increment.
