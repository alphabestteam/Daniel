File handling-
1.1
    •	File handling allow the user to perform a lot of actions such as creating or reading, writing and so on.
        It can works with different files types. Python provides good interface for file handling, 
        so it will be easy for user to perform one of the actions I mentioned before.
    •	And why we need this? It allows us to store data that can be accessed by our code and apply one of the actions. It also allows us to treat a file as an object
    •	Why not use only variables to store data? because the variables are volatile. This is why we need to handle in files.
1.2
    •	Built in function called “open”  the code is like this -- open('filename', mode)
        File name as it. The file of the name
    Mode – what action we do.
		‘r’ – read. = open file for reading.
		‘a’ – open file for appending or create the file if doesn’t exist.
		‘w’ – write to the file. Also creates the file if not exist
		‘x’ – create file.

Json 
    •	Json is short of Java Script Object Notation. 
        It format for storing data. Json file is more easy to understand because his format.
        It is often used for data exchange between a server and a web application or between different parts of an application.

    In Python, you use the json module to work with JSON files. 
    The main functions we  use are:

        json.load(file): Reads a JSON file and parses it into a Python dictionary or list.
        json.dump(data, file): Writes a Python dictionary or list as a JSON file.
        json.loads(json_string): Parses a JSON string and converts it into a Python dictionary or list.
        json.dumps(data): Converts a Python dictionary or list into a JSON string.
